TELEMO SMS is a telephony module intended for use with version 6.x of Drupal, with the core TeleMo telephony module, and (optionally) with version 2.x of Ubercart.

This module simplifies access to various business APIs (currently CallFire and Twilio) to use their telephony services. This module specifically focuses on the SMS portions of their APIs, allowing both manual and automated sending of text messages, as well as responding to incoming text messages.
